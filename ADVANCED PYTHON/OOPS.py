      OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
      ---------------------------
-> python is also an object-oriented language since its beginning.
-> It allows us to develop applications using an object-oriented approach.
-> An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects.
-> principles of object-oriented programming system

   1. Object
   2. Class
   3. Method
   4. Inheritance
   5. Polymorphism
   6. Data abstraction
   7. Encapsulation

Object
------
-> The object is related to real-world entities.
-> Objects are the building blocks of a program in OOP, and they can be created using classes.
-> Everything in python is an object,and almsot everything has attributes and methods.

Class
-----
->  A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.
-> It is a design pattern for object
-> collection of objects
-> When we define a class,it needs to create an object to allocate the memory
syntax:

-> class creation

class class_name:
    attributes1
    attributes2
       -
       -
       -
    methods1   
    methods2

-> object creation   

object_name = class_name() 


class student:
   attributes
   1.name
   2.rollno
   3.course

   methods
   1.add_method()
   2.display()
